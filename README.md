# Sentiment-Analysis
Worked on a Sentiment Analysis project using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to classify customer feedback into positive and negative sentiments.

Sentiment Analysis of Customer Feedback !!!!

Introduction

Understanding what customers think is key to improving any product or service. This project focuses on using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze customer feedback and categorize it as either positive or negative. It’s a simple yet effective way to interpret feedback at scale and make better business decisions.
What This Project Does

This project processes customer reviews, extracts useful insights, and classifies them into positive or negative sentiments. With an accuracy of 99%, it’s highly reliable and capable of handling varied feedback efficiently.
Tools and Technologies

The project is built using Python and the following libraries:

    Pandas: For handling and analyzing data.
    NumPy: For numerical computations.
    NLTK: For processing textual data, such as cleaning and tokenization.
    Scikit-learn: For training and evaluating machine learning models.

How It Works

Here’s an overview of the workflow:

    Data Collection:
    Collected real customer feedback from publicly available datasets.

    Text Cleaning:
        Removed noise, special characters, and unnecessary words from the data.
        Tokenized sentences and filtered out stopwords.

    Feature Engineering:
        Transformed the cleaned text into numerical form using techniques like TF-IDF.

    Model Training:
        Trained multiple models, including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and SVM.
        The best model was optimized to achieve 99% accuracy on the test dataset.

    Prediction:
        The final model predicts whether a new feedback entry is positive or negative.

How to Run the Project

If you want to test it out yourself, follow these steps:

    Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Swayam1911/sentiment-analysis.git
cd sentiment-analysis

Install the required libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the main script:

    python sentiment_analysis.py

Results

The project delivers a strong performance, with the model achieving an accuracy of 99% in classifying feedback. This makes it a dependable solution for analyzing sentiments across large datasets.
What’s Next?

Here are some potential improvements I’m considering:

    Multi-language Support: Expanding the model to process feedback in multiple languages.
    Real-Time Feedback: Creating a web application to analyze sentiments on the fly.
    Advanced Models: Experimenting with deep learning approaches like BERT for even better results.

Acknowledgments

This project wouldn’t have been possible without the amazing open-source libraries and the support of the Python/NLP community.
